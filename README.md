# Spotify Dashboard
***On-Going Project***

Project started by Josh Stepahni (UW-Madison, CS & Astrophysics) and continued with his great friend Ben Giese (MSOE, SE). This was a "play around" project that utilizes the *Spotify Web-API* and a Front-End UI to manipulate and control a person's Spotify Account. We also added Search, Queue, and an Interactive Progress Bar functionality that works apart from Spotify. 

### Dashboard:

### Notes:

**Queue Dropdown**
Onclick, Dropdown show items.
- Remove - removeFromQueue(index number)
- Play Next - (smart - "Multiple Play Nexts" line up) add first on dropdown, then on search results.

**Make UI Better**
- Make search results and queue different colors. (Use JQuery to select all and change style)
- Dashboard - Large Track Text displayed in dashboard.
